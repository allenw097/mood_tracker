# Mood of the Queue

This is a simple internal tool that lets support agents log the mood of the ticket queue and visualize the emotional trends.

## Features

- **Log a Mood:** Select an emoji to represent the current mood (ðŸ˜Š, ðŸ˜ , ðŸ˜•, ðŸŽ‰) and add an optional note.
- **Visualization:** Displays a bar chart of mood counts for the current day.
- **Storage:** Each entry (timestamp, mood, note) is appended to a Google Sheet.
- **Bonus:** Optional auto-refresh of the chart, filtering by emoji, and grouping by day.
